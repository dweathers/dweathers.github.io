### Tutoring

During the summer of 2020 (starting May 13) I will take on some clients for private web tutoring.

* Any high school and most college level subjects
* Video conference platform of your choice; I will screenshare from OneNote
* Flexible payment based on income and COVID-affected job status
* "Bundle" deals available (e.g. prepay for 9 sessions get 1 free)
* 30-minute demo session available

My tutoring style is to lead the student through a problem until they come up with the correct answer on their own. The ideal student will be self-motivated and interested to know the "why" of it all.

Because the obvious conflict of interest I will not tutor students at Coastal Carolina.

If you are interested please e-mail `wdweathers` at `gmail` dot `com`.

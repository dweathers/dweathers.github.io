## Douglas Weathers

I am a lecturer of mathematics and statistics at [Coastal Carolina University](https://www.coastal.edu/). My interests include category theory, probability and statistics, combinatorics, and the sociology of mathematics. In order, those are: arrows between stuff; randomness; counting; and understanding the way mathematics is done and learned by the *humans* who do and learn mathematics.

I recently discovered the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io/) which led me back to GitHub after a few years away. (I was never any good at it.) I also needed a small website. So, here is my GitHub page.

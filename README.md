You may be here for my open source resource for introductory discrete math, *Elementary discrete mathematics*. [You can find it here.](174/index.html)

I am a lecturer of mathematics and statistics at [Coastal Carolina University](https://www.coastal.edu/). My interests include 
- category theory,
- probability and statistics,
- combinatorics,
- and the sociology of mathematics. 

In order, those things can be very loosely described as 
- arrows between stuff,
- randomness,
- counting, 
- and understanding the way mathematics is done and learned by the *humans* who do and learn mathematics.

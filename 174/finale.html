<p>Congratulations! You have either read all of, or scrolled to the end of, <em>Elementary discrete mathematics</em>. What next?</p>
<p>If you are a computer science student in your first year, i.e. a member of the target audience of this book, you either will take calculus or have taken it recently. Asymptotics can be phrased in terms of limits. The binomial theorem will give you a powerful tool in computing difficult integrals. You will look at infinite sequences and sums. Most importantly, you have hopefully gained some confidence in mathematics, and you will go on with a greater ability to read and do math.</p>
<p>With perseverance and a good group of people to work with, there’s not a lot you <em>can’t</em> do after reading this book. I don’t claim this book is magic, or has taught you everything you need to know. What I <em>do</em> claim is that once you know about sets and how to read and write a proof, and maybe have some familiarity with recursion, the tapestry of mathematics is open to you, especially after learning the language of calculus and the examples therein. I am particularly fond of <a href="http://www.rellek.net/book/app-comb.html">combinatorics</a> and <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-category-theory-anyway">category theory</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t want to do anymore math? That’s fine too, I guess. Maybe this book helped you organize your mental machinery for other areas of your life. Maybe you have found within you a confidence to solve problems you did not think you could.</p>
<p>Whatever powers, if any, this book gave you, use them for good, and live well.</p>

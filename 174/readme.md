# This is MATH 174. Ok!

## Notes to self about the book

### Todo

Dark mode
Screen reading

### Every video description

Meant to be watched before or after reading Chapter X of the open source textbook Elementary Discrete Mathematics (https://dweathers.github.io/174/book.html).

### References to later chapters that need filling in:
* Mention empty set proof in chapter 3
* Multisets (after def 1.3.2)
* Fundamental counting (end of 1.3 and after 2.1.3)

### Include something like this acknowledgement. 

*Acknowledgements.* This book was written with the open-source tool [stackedit.io](http://stackedit.io). Thanks to the countless (okay, countable) MATH 174 students who have honed my presentation over the years, my supportive department including my chair Tom Hoffman and associate chair Lindsey Bell, and my girlfriend Amber for putting up with me during the COVID 19 lockdown (which cannot be easy).

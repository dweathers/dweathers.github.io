This is MATH 174. Ok!

## Notes to self about the book

In the example following def 1.3.2, multisets are hinted at. Make sure to link that when it's done.

Include something like this acknowledgement. 

*Acknowledgements.* This book was written with the open-source tool [stackedit.io](http://stackedit.io). Thanks to the countless (okay, countable) MATH 174 students who have honed my presentation over the years, my supportive department including my chair Tom Hoffman and associate chair Lindsey Bell, and my girlfriend Amber for putting up with me during the COVID 19 lockdown (which cannot be easy).

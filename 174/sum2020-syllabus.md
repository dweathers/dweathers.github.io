### Introduction

**Welcome to MATH 174!**

This is a class about learning to communicate mathematically. The goal is that at the end of the course a student who once was nervous about approaching new and difficult mathematics will be emboldened.

We will learn this boldness in the context of discrete mathematics, which is frustratingly defined as "the study of discrete structures." A discrete structure is something whose elements enjoy a clear separation from each other; consider that the numbers 1 and 2 are clearly distinct. As  a counterexample consider that there is not such a clear distinction between the numbers 1, 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, and so on. Examples of discrete structures include sets, families of statements with logical connectives, sequences, Boolean matrices, graphs, and partial orders. Oh, and you're also going to learn how to count *real good.*

This course is a challenging one. Work hard, have faith in your own abilities, and reach out to me and your classmates when you need help!

### Course materials

You will be provided with a [free web textbook](http://dweathers.github.io/174/index.html) and a series of videos (linked from the book). You are intended to use these yourself, and use the office hours to ask questions about what you have learned.

The videos and the book are meant to compliment one another. The book is much more thorough, and the videos are meant to provide short demonstrations and examples. Some students may prefer to watch the videos before diving into the book's motivation and explanations; other students may prefer to read the text and then watch an example in action. Try both orders to see which works best for you, but *use both resources*.

We will use Microsoft Teams to communicate with one another. The link to join has been e-mailed to you. If you are not happy with your name in the Coastal Carolina system, you are welcome to join with another e-mail address.

### What we can expect from each other

**Communication:** You are encouraged to contact me via e-mail or Teams (direct message or class chat). I will respond to all correspondence within 24 hours if not sooner (correspondence sent Friday may receive a response Monday).

I love talking to students! *That's why I am here.* Don't hesitate to reach out as soon as you have trouble with the material, or for any other reason.

**Code of conduct:** In a typical summer course we would see each other every day and our course community would grow naturally. Because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic makes in-person meetings dangerous, we will have to mindfully create our community online. To that end, you may find yourself speaking to your classmates online more often than you would expect to.

This is an inclusive classroom where students of all races, ethnicities, genders, religions, sexual orientations, and abilities are encouraged to learn mathematics. You are to respect your fellow classmates at all times.

Access to our community workspace is a privilege. Students who harass their classmates may lose that privilege, and if an offense is particularly egregious there will not be a warning.

**Academic integrity:** Coastal Carolina University is an academic community that expects the highest standards of honesty, integrity and personal responsibility. Members of this community are accountable for their actions and are committed to creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. For more, see [https://www.coastal.edu/aic].

**Accomodations:** Coastal Carolina University is committed to equitable access and inclusion of individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Individuals seeking reasonable accommodations should contact Accessibility & Disability Services (843-349-2503 or [https://www.coastal.edu/disabilityservices/]).

### Required statements and other such legalese

**Prerequisite:** MATH 130/130I with a C or better.

**Course topics:** Set theory, logic, proofs, recursion, sequences, asymptotics, induction, combinatorics, probability, relations, digraphs, and Boolean algebra.

**Course objectives:** Successful students in this course will learn particular mathematical
facts and then apply them. This will be achieved through five themes: mathematical
reasoning, combinatorial analysis, discrete structures, algorithmic thinking, and applications
and modeling.

**Student outcomes:** Students successfully completing MATH 174 will have the ability to:
* Translate English statements to logic expressions, and simplify those expressions.
* Use direct and inductive proof techniques to prove mathematical statements.
* Work with the basic concepts of sets and set operations.
* Use modular arithmetic and congruences.
* Use basic counting principles to compute probabilities.
* Work with relations by way of Boolean matrices and digraphs.
* Communicate mathematically with their peers.

### Grading

MATH 174 employs **mastery-based grading**, which is designed to make both of our lives better. Each assessed problem in the homework and the weekly exams may be reassessed, so that your failures are productive.

With that in mind, the summer semester MATH 174 course will be graded in the following categories.

**Homework.** Each week you will be assigned a selection of problems from the textbook. These problems will be due the day before that week's exam so that I may post solutions. For that reason, **no late homework will be accepted.** I will choose a few of these problems to assess.

Problems in the homework and in the free response portions of the exams will be graded on the E/M/P/I scale.

* (E) A solution is *excellent* if it contains no mathematical errors and demonstrates complete understanding. An excellent solution is written clearly, concisely, and in logical order, and contains very few spelling or grammatical errors.
* (M) A solution *meets expectations* if it contains few mathematical errors, none of which are significant. It is clear that the student understands the material being assessed. There may be issues with spelling, grammar, or logical order, but they are few and minor.
* (P) A solution is *progressing* if it demonstrates partial understanding, but contains significant mathematical errors. The writing may be unclear, unnecessarily verbose, or out of order, and may contain significant spelling or grammatical errors.
* (I) A solution is *incomplete* if it is only partially completed or if the writing is completely unclear or illegible. The incomplete solution shows that the student does not yet understand the material, and that further learning is required.
* (NR) A solution is *not revisable* if it was not attempted at all; or if the attempt is obviously not in good faith. A solution (or lack thereof) marked "not revisable" is -- you guessed it! -- not eligible to be revised, because the student may be sandbagging for a free one-week extension. You should make a good effort on every problem.

Another feature of mastery-based grading is rewarding growth. You are not expected to know everything on the first day of class -- just by the last day! So, you will be able to revise much of your work in this class.

When each assignment's solutions are posted, you will have a good idea of whether you did well. At this point, you may choose up to two problems on that assignment to be reassessed. The homework may be revised as many times as necessary *within one week of the solutions being posted,* subject to my ability to respond and give meaningful feedback. (So for best results, e-mail early.) If you score better on the new problems, the better score will replace the old one.

**Weekly exams.** There will be an exam on the Monday of the second, third, fourth, and fifth weeks. These exams will be taken in person over Teams in a two-hour block. Exam problems will be similar to homework problems.

Each exam beginning with the second will give you a chance to revise questions from the previous exam. For example, the third exam will contain questions from the material covered since the second exam -- all of which must be attempted -- and questions from the material covered on the second exam. Keep track of how well you do on each exam question, and if necessary, you may choose questions from this group to revise. The final exam will contain questions that allow you to revise questions from the fourth exam.

**Final exam.** On the last day of class there will be a final exam. It will be a longer exam of the same type as the weekly exams. The final exam may not be revised.

**Participation.** I have an introductory activity planned, as well as weekly activities. Participation in these will earn a score of Good, Adequate, or Lacking at the end of the semester. Students who make a good-faith effort to participate in all of the activities will earn a Good; students who only participate in some activities or participate half-heartedly will earn an Adequate; students who do not participate enough for an Adequate score will earn a Lacking. Your participation score is up to my discretion, but you may expect it to be administered fairly.

**Your final grade.** One goal of mastery-based grading is that you will always know what your grade is and what needs to be done in order to pass the course. Below are the minimum cutoffs for each grade.

|Grade|Exams (weekly and final)|Homework|Participation|
|--|--|--|--|
|A|80% E/M, 40% E|90% E/M, 60% E|Good|
|B|70% E/M, 30% E|80% E/M, 50% E|Good|
|C|60% E/M, 20% E|70% E/M, 40% E|Adequate|
|D|50% E/M|60% E/M|Adequate|

Furthermore, all three requirements must be met for a grade; earning two out of three requirements will result in the "plus" version of the grade below. Since there is no F+, failure to earn achieve all three D-level criteria will result in a grade of F. Consider the following examples.

* Alicia works hard all semester and participates enthusiastically in every activity. After revising, 85% of her exam questions are at the E/M level, with 50% at the E level. Also, 96% of her homework is at the E/M level, with 80% at the E level. Therefore, Alicia will earn an A.
* Bob starts off well but starts to slack off towards the end of the class. He doesn't revise as much as he should, and doesn't reach out to his instructor when he needs help. At the end of the semester he has good participation and 80% of his homework at the E/M level (62% E), but after the final only 60% of his exam problems are at the E/M level. Since he has met two of the three B conditions, Bob will only earn a C+.

### "Attendance"

You are expected to attend class every day. Here are the things we will consider "attending class":
* Attending that day's live office hour session,
* Sending me a substantial e-mail about course material, or
* Having a substantial (public) conversation with a classmate about material.

What qualifies as a "substantial" conversation is up to my discretion, but I intend to be reasonable. Here are two examples of substantial conversations, one of each type.

*Hi Douglas, I am confused about the third example in the office hour recording. You say that the only upper bound of A = {a,b,c} is c. However, d is above b. Why wouldn't d be an upper bound as well? Thanks, [STUDENT WHO OVERSLEPT].*

(In the following example, Alicia missed office hours because she had to take care of her younger sibling. Bob posts first on our Microsoft Teams channel. This conversation would count as attendance for Bob as well, had he also missed office hours.)
*BOB: Hey, I'm having trouble with the fourth problem on the homework. I'm getting 36 as my answer, but I'm not sure it's right.
ALICIA: I got 84 for my answer. What did you do?
BOB: I did (7-1+3 choose 7), like the video said.
ALICIA: Oh yeah... Since we're choosing 3 objects out of 7 with replacement, n=7 and r=3. So it's (7-1+3 choose 3), not choose 7.
BOB: Oh, duh. Thanks.*

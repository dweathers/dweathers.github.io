### Course materials

You will be provided with a free web textbook and a series of videos. You are intended to use these yourself, and use the office hours to ask questions about what you have learned.

The videos and the book are meant to compliment one another. The book is much more thorough, and the videos are meant to provide short demonstrations and examples. Some students may prefer to watch the videos before diving into the book's motivation and explanations; other students may prefer to read the text and then watch an example in action. Try both to see which works best for you, but *use both resources*.

### Grading

MATH 174 employs **mastery-based grading**, which is designed to make both of our lives better. Each assessed problem in the Homework and the free-response part of the Weekly Exam categories may be re-assessed, so that you may learn from your failure.

With that in mind, the summer semester MATH 174 course will be graded in the following categories.

**Homework.** Each week you will be assigned a selection of problems from the textbook. These problems will be due the day before that week's exam so that I may post solutions. For that reason, **no late homework will be accepted.** I will choose a few of these problems to assess. Please note that the homework carries the same weight as the final exam; this is to express my belief that doing the homework is just as important as studying for exams. (In fact, doing the homework *is* studying for the exams!)

Problems in the homework and in the free response portions of the exams will be graded on the E/M/P/I scale.

* (E) A solution is *excellent* if it contains no mathematical errors and demonstrates complete understanding. An excellent solution is written clearly, concisely, and in logical order, and contains very few spelling or grammatical errors.
* (M) A solution *meets expectations* if it contains few mathematical errors, none of which are significant. It is clear that the student understands the material being assessed. There may be issues with spelling, grammar, or logical order, but they are few and minor.
* (P) A solution is *progressing* if it demonstrates partial understanding, but contains significant mathematical errors. The writing may be unclear, unnecessarily verbose, or out of order, and may contain significant spelling or grammatical errors.
* (I) A solution is *incomplete* if it is only partially completed or if the writing is completely unclear or illegible. The incomplete solution shows that the student does not yet understand the material, and that further learning is required.
* (NR) A solution is *not revisable* if it was not attempted at all; or if the attempt is obviously not in good faith. A solution (or lack thereof) marked "not revisable" is -- you guessed it! -- not eligible to be revised, because the student may be sandbagging for a free one-week extension. You should make a good effort on every problem.

**Weekly exams.** Every week there will be an exam consisting of two parts: (I) a timed multiple choice portion and (II) an open-note free-response portion. The multiple choice portion is designed to test whether you have retained enough basic information about the concepts; the time will be strict enough that you would rather not use your notes. The free-response portion will be more difficult, but you are allowed to use your notes, and some of these problems may be reassessed. **Though you may use your notes on the free-response portion, you are not allowed to collaborate with any other person. This includes posting the question to tutoring services. I will find out, and you will earn a 0.**

**Final exam.** On the last day of class there will be a final exam. It will be a longer exam of the same type as the weekly exams, and again, **you will earn a 0 if you are caught trying to collaborate.**

**Participation.** I have an introductory activity planned, as well as weekly activities. Participation in these will earn a score of Good, Adequate, or Lacking at the end of the semester. Students who make a good-faith effort to participate in all of the activities will earn a Good; students who only participate in some activities or participate half-heartedly will earn an Adequate; students who do not participate enough for an Adequate score will earn a Lacking. Your participation score is up to my discretion.

**Your final grade.** One goal of mastery-based grading is that you will always know what your grade is and what needs to be done in order to pass the course. (Alternatively: you should never have to ask me what your grade is, because I *hate* getting asked about grades.)

|Grade|Exams (weekly and final)|Homework|Participation|
|--|--|--|--|
|A|80% E/M, 40% E|90% E/M, 60% E|Good|
|B|70% E/M, 30% E|80% E/M, 50% E|Good|
|C|60% E/M, 20% E|70% E/M, 40% E|Adequate|
|D|50% E/M|60% E/M|Adequate|

Above are the minimum cutoffs for each grade. Furthermore, all three requirements must be met for a grade; earning two out of three requirements will result in the "plus" version of the grade below. Consider the following examples.

* Alicia works hard all semester and participates enthusiastically in every activity. After revising, 85% of her exam questions are at the E/M level, with 50% at the E level. Also, 96% of her homework is at the E/M level, with 80% at the E level. Therefore, Alicia will earn an A.
* Bob starts off well but starts to slack off towards the end of the class. He doesn't revise as much as he should, and doesn't reach out to his instructor when he needs help. At the end of the semester he has good participation and 80% of his homework at the E/M level (62% E), but after the final only 60% of his exam problems are at the E/M level. Since he has met two of the three B conditions, Bob will only earn a C+.

### Reassessment

We have seen that mastery grading is simple to grade (what is the difference between a 5 and a 6 on a 10-point question, anyway?) and easy for the student to keep track of. Mastery grading is also meant to reward growth. You are not expected to know everything on the first day of class -- just by the last day! So, you will be able to revise much of your work in this class.

**Homework reassessment:** For each homework problem that does not earn a score of E, you may e-mail me *within a week of the homework being graded* to request a similar problem. If you score better on the new problem, the better score will replace the old one.

**Exam reassessment:** Each exam beginning with the second will give you a chance to revise questions from the previous exam. For example, the third exam will contain questions from the material covered since the second exam -- all of which must be attempted -- and questions from the material covered on the second exam. Keep track of how well you do on each exam question, and if necessary, you may choose questions from this group to revise. The final exam will contain questions that allow you to revise questions from the fourth exam. The final exam may not be revised. 

### "Attendance"

You are expected to attend class every day. Here are the things we will consider "attending class":
* Attending that day's live office hour session,
* Sending me a substantial e-mail about course material, or
* Having a substantial (public) conversation with a classmate about material.

What qualifies as a "substantial" conversation is up to my discretion, but I intend to be reasonable. Here are two examples of substantial conversations, one of each type.

*Hi Douglas, I am confused about the third example in the office hour recording. You say that the only upper bound of A = {a,b,c} is c. However, d is above b. Why wouldn't d be an upper bound as well? Thanks, [STUDENT WHO OVERSLEPT DURING OFFICE HOURS].*

(In the following example, Alicia missed office hours because she had to take care of her younger sibling. Bob posts first on our Microsoft Teams channel.)
*BOB: Hey, I'm having trouble with the fourth problem on the homework. I'm getting 36 as my answer, but I'm not sure it's right.
ALICIA: I got 84 for my answer. What did you do?
BOB: I did (7-1+3 choose 7), like the video said.
ALICIA: Oh yeah... Since we're choosing 3 objects out of 7 with replacement, n=7 and r=3. So it's (7-1+3 choose 3), not choose 7.
BOB: Oh, duh. Thanks.*

### Introduction

**Welcome to STAT 201**

Statistics answers the follow question: given some data, what does the underlying population look like? Probability answers the inverse question: given a population, how likely are we to see some particular data? We live in a time where the benefits of understanding probability and statistics are hopefully abundantly clear.

### Course delivery

Prior to September 8, all courses at Coastal Carolina University will be streamed online. *After September 8, STAT 201-01 will continue to be streamed online.*

Lectures will be delivered synchronously via Zoom. The link will be available on Moodle. Students who still wish to use their assigned classroom who chose the Class modality on WebAdvisor may do so. If you are accessing the Zoom meeting from a University building, you are expected to wear a mask and practice social distancing (per University guidelines and good common sense).

### Course materials

You will need a copy of the *Understanding Statistics* lab manual by Bell, Jagannathan, and Pritchard (2nd edition). A link to purchase the manual is available on Moodle. Also you will need the lecture notes (Moodle) and a TI-83 or 84 series calculator.

### What we can expect from each other

**Communication:** You are encouraged to contact me via e-mail or Teams (direct message or class chat). I will respond to all correspondence within 24 hours if not sooner (correspondence sent Friday may receive a response Monday).

I love talking to students! *That's why I am here.* Don't hesitate to reach out as soon as you have trouble with the material, or for any other reason.

**Code of conduct:** Because we will not meet in person, we will have to mindfully create our community online. To that end, you may find yourself speaking to your classmates online more often than you would expect to.

This is an inclusive classroom where students of all races, ethnicities, genders, religions, sexual orientations, and abilities are encouraged to learn mathematics. You are to respect your fellow classmates at all times.

Access to our community is a privilege. Students who harass their classmates may lose that privilege, and if an offense is particularly egregious there will not be a warning.

I won't be an accomplice to bad public health practices. If I can tell you are accessing the Zoom meeting from a public space and you are not wearing a mask, you will be made to leave the meeting.

**Academic integrity:** Coastal Carolina University is an academic community that expects the highest standards of honesty, integrity and personal responsibility. Members of this community are accountable for their actions and are committed to creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. For more, see [https://www.coastal.edu/aic](https://www.coastal.edu/aic).

**Accomodations:** Coastal Carolina University is committed to equitable access and inclusion of individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Individuals seeking reasonable accommodations should contact Accessibility & Disability Services (843-349-2503 or [https://www.coastal.edu/disabilityservices/](https://www.coastal.edu/disabilityservices/)).

### Required statements and other such legalese

**Prerequisite:** A grade of C or better in MATH 130 or 130I. The lab, STAT 201L, is a corequisite, meaning it must be taken at the same time. Your work in STAT 201L comprises 9% of the grade of STAT 201, but you receive the same letter grade for both classes.

**Course objectives:** A student completing this course successfully is expected to (amongst other things)
* Analyze data using numerical and graphical summaries.
* Compute the probability of various random phenomena.
* Estimate parameters using a variety of techniques.
* Assess the strength of evidence for hypotheses of interest.

**Student outcomes:** Student learning should include but not be restricted to the following outcomes:

* By the end of the course, students will be able to describe a given data set using measures of center and dispersion.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to decide when a data set follows the Normal or Binomial distributions and perform calculations based on the those distributions.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to calculate the equation of the line of best fit to a linear relationship between two variables and use that equation to predict future data points.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to explain the relationship between two categorical variables and perform necessary calculations to support their explanation.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to distinguish between observational studies and experiments and also between the different sampling designs.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to distinguish between the various experimental designs and be able to select the best design for their purpose.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to calculate and interpret various confidence intervals.
* By the end of the course, students will be able to perform tests of hypotheses, accurately calculate evidence for or against the hypothesis being tested (via p-values), and explain the conclusions in complete sentences in terms of the problem.

### Grading

|Component|Weight|
|--|--|
|Lab activities|9%|
|Quizzes|13%|
|Homework|13%|
|Exams|60%|
|Final project|5%|

|Letter grade|Course total|
|--|--|
|A|90-100|
|B+|87-89|
|B|80-86|
|C+|77-79|
|C|70-76|
|D+|67-69|
|D|60-66|
|F|0-59|

Note regarding grades: If, at the semester, your grade is above 67.0% and below 69.49%, your grade will be a D+. You will not be “bumped up” to a C. If your course average is at least 69.0% and the final exam score is higher than a 70.0%, and only in that case, a committee of faculty will meet to discuss grades on a case-by-case basis. This meeting will happen automatically.

**Homework:**  A list of practice problems can be found in the required text beginning on page 95.  A selection of the problems will be assigned each week. For each assignment, write your solutions on notebook paper or type up your solutions. If you write up your solutions, use a scanner or scanning app to scan your homework solutions as a PDF file for submission to Moodle. If you type up your solutions, save the document as a PDF file prior to submission.  A link for each assignment will be available on Moodle.

Make sure your solutions to problems are worked out in the order given below and that all your answers are neatly written in the form of a sentence (with the exception of constructing graphs). If applicable, answers of the form "median = 7" is considered a sentence.  If you are using a scanning app, make sure your scans are the correct orientation and do not cut off some of your work.

These homework problems are meant to be practice problems towards the quizzes and exams.  The overall homework average is worth 13% of the course grade.  The lowest homework grade will be dropped.

**Quizzes:** Quizzes will be given every Friday beginning on the second week of class except during the weeks of exams. Quizzes will be taken on Moodle.  The quiz will open each Friday at 9:00 AM and will close the following morning at 9:00AM.  Quiz problems are often conceptually derived from the homework. Missed quizzes cannot be made up (See missed assignment policy above). The overall quiz average is worth 13% of the course grade.  The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.

**Exams:** There will be three exams during the semester. Exams will be partly multiple choice type problems and partly short/long answer type problems. Due to the nature of statistics courses, exams may cover any material since the beginning of the course. You may use your calculator on all exams. Appropriate statistical tables will be provided for all exams.  All exams will be conducted during lab periods.  Depending on choice of locality, an exam may be administered in the classroom and on Moodle.  Those who chose a streaming locality will be proctored synchronously via Zoom/Teams at the same time as the in-person examination.  LockDown Browser will be required to take the exam online.  If an excused absence results in students missing an exam (these must be set up at least one day ahead of time), then a make-up exam will be provided.  Each exam is worth 20% of the course grade.

|Exam|Date|
|--|--|
|Exam 1|Tuesday, September 15 or Thursday, September 17|
|Exam 2|Tuesday, October 13 or Thursday, October 15|
|Exam 3|Tuesday, November 17 or Thursday, November 19|

**Lab:** STAT 201 and STAT 201L are co-requisites. To that end, the grade you receive in STAT 201 will be the grade you receive in STAT 201L. There will be a lab or class activities every lab period except during the week of exams.  Lab activities will be conducted synchronously online.  Similar to the homework assignments, solutions to lab activities should be scanned using a scanning app and submitted to Moodle as a PDF.  These activities are worth 9% of the course grade.

**Final project:** You will receive a small case study with observed data.  You will be asked a sequence of questions related to the study that will assess a multitude of concepts learned throughout the course.  Through this project, you will hopefully gain a better understanding of the complete process of statistical analysis. Your solutions to the final project are worth 5% of the course grade and are due on Friday, December 4.

### "Attendance"

Students are obligated to attend class regularly.  Absences,  excused or not, do not absolve students from the responsibility of completing all assigned work promptly.  

Students are expected to attend all Zoom meetings when they are live. They will be recorded, but failure to attend the live session will still count as an absence. If your personal circumstances keep you from attending the live class, please let me know immediately.

### The terms of this syllabus are subject to change fairly and with ample notice as needed.

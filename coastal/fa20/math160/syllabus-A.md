### Introduction

**Welcome to MATH 160!**

Calculus is the study of change. Given small changes in one quantity, how does another change? Time and distance? Temperature and volume? Labor and GDP? From another perspective, calculus is the story of how humans began to understand infinity: the infinitely small, as well as the infinitely many.

### Course delivery

Prior to September 8, all courses at Coastal Carolina University will be streamed online. *After September 8, MATH 160A-09 will continue to be streamed online.*

Lectures will be delivered synchronously via Zoom. The link will be available on Moodle. Students who still wish to use their assigned classroom who chose the Class modality on WebAdvisor may do so. If you are accessing the Zoom meeting from a University building, you are expected to wear a mask and practice social distancing (per University guidelines and good common sense).

### Course materials

We will use WebAssign. [Use this link to purchase access at a discounted rate.](http://services.cengagebrain.com/course/site.html?id=3981474) You also may want a calculator to do some basic computations; however, the calculator should not be used for the actual calculus work (taking derivatives and integrals), and you will be required to show the correct work for credit. No calculator of level TI-89 or higher (or calculator that can do symbolic manipulation) is allowed for any exams or quizzes.  If you have questions about your calculator please let me know.  Cell phones and tablets are not an acceptable substitute for a calculator and will NOT be allowed.

### What we can expect from each other

**Communication:** You are encouraged to contact me via e-mail or Teams (direct message or class chat). I will respond to all correspondence within 24 hours if not sooner (correspondence sent Friday may receive a response Monday).

I love talking to students! *That's why I am here.* Don't hesitate to reach out as soon as you have trouble with the material, or for any other reason.

**Code of conduct:** Because we will not meet in person, we will have to mindfully create our community online. To that end, you may find yourself speaking to your classmates online more often than you would expect to.

This is an inclusive classroom where students of all races, ethnicities, genders, religions, sexual orientations, and abilities are encouraged to learn mathematics. You are to respect your fellow classmates at all times.

Access to our community is a privilege. Students who harass their classmates may lose that privilege, and if an offense is particularly egregious there will not be a warning.

I won't be an accomplice to bad public health practices. If I can tell you are accessing the Zoom meeting from a public space and you are not wearing a mask, you will be made to leave the meeting.

**Academic integrity:** Coastal Carolina University is an academic community that expects the highest standards of honesty, integrity and personal responsibility. Members of this community are accountable for their actions and are committed to creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. For more, see [https://www.coastal.edu/aic](https://www.coastal.edu/aic).

**Accomodations:** Coastal Carolina University is committed to equitable access and inclusion of individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Individuals seeking reasonable accommodations should contact Accessibility & Disability Services (843-349-2503 or [https://www.coastal.edu/disabilityservices/](https://www.coastal.edu/disabilityservices/)).

### Required statements and other such legalese

**Prerequisite:** MATH 130 or MATH 130I and a grade of C or better in MATH 131, or a grade of C or better in MATH 135, or by Mathematics Placement.

**Course topics:** Limits, continuity, differentiation of algebraic and transcendental functions, rates of change in the natural and social sciences, and exponential growth and decay.

**Course objectives:** We will develop the basic tools of differential calculus, limits and derivatives, and learn how to apply them to a variety of problems.  We will see how calculus can help  us  understand  the  relationship  between  average  and  instantaneous  rates  of change, and the relationship between distance, velocity and acceleration.  We will also solve problems of rates of change in the Natural and Social Sciences.

**Student outcomes:** Student learning outcomes for Math 160A (Calculus IA) fall into one of the following two categories:  computational and conceptual. The following list summarizes the fundamental computational skills and conceptsof calculus a student will posses when they successfully complete Math 160A.

1.  Compute average rates of change and instantaneous rates of change of a certain quantity as well as the ability to explain the relationship between these two types of rates of change.
2.  Solve the classic problem of finding the equation of the line tangent to the graph of a differentiable function at a given point.
3.  Explain  the  relationship  between  the  slope  of  a  tangent  line  and  the  instantaneous  rate  of  change. Explain the relationship between the slope of a secant and the average rate of change.
4.  Compute a variety of limits using numerical and graphical techniques, limit laws and algebraic techniques.
5.  Identify  continuous  functions  as  well  as  explain  why  a  function  is  or  is  not  continuous.   Apply  the Intermediate Value Theorem to an equation to show that a solution does or does not exist.
6.  Compute several basic derivatives using the definition of the derivative such as polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and inverse trigonometric functions.   The  ability  to  use  the  product  rule,  quotient  rule,  chain  rule,  implicit  differentiation, and logarithmic differentiation to compute the derivatives of more complicated functions.
7.  Solve  the  following  types  of  applied  problems:   rates  of  change  in  the  natural  and  social  sciences, exponential growth and decay.

### Grading

|Component|Weight|
|--|--|
|Paper homework|10%|
|Quizzes|10%|
|WebAssign homework|10%|
|Midterm exam|30%|
|Final exam|40%|

|Letter grade|Course total|
|--|--|
|A|90-100|
|B+|87-89|
|B|80-86|
|C+|77-79|
|C|70-76|
|D+|67-69|
|D|60-66|
|F|0-59|

**Homework:** There will be weekly Online Homework Assignments that can be found by logging into your Webassign account (Not Moodle).  In addition, there will be weekly Written Homework Assignments, which can be found in Moodle.

**Quizzes:** There will be weekly (or weekly-ish) quizzes in Webassign. You must submit your written work on Moodle within 15 minutes of completing your quiz to receive credit. For full credit, the work provided must match the answer given. You can prepare for the quizzes by reviewing your class notes and assigned homework problems. The lowest quiz grade will not be included in the final quiz average.

**Exams:** There will be one 50-minute midterm exam and a cumulative final exam. The tentative dates are as follows.

|Date|Exam|Sections|
|--|--|--|
|September 14|Midterm|2.2,2.3,2.5-2.8,3.1-3.2|
|October 5 (starting at 6pm)|Final|Cumulative|

Note carefully the final exam is the evening of October 5. Because the grades must be put in the next day, it must be taken this evening. If you work in the evenings, ask off this date now.

Exam  dates  are  subject  to  change. Important: Make-up exams, turning in late homework assignments, and make-up quizzes are possible with the proper documentation, that is, an excused absence.  Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me regarding situations that fall outside those of an excused absence.  In any of these situations, quick and prompt communication is encouraged.

### Important dates

|Date|Event|
|--|--|
|Tuesday, August 25|Last day for late registration, drop/add with no academic record|
|Monday, September 7|Labor day holiday - no classes|
|Thursday, September 17|Last day to drop with a grade of W|
|Monday, October 5|Last day of classes|

### "Attendance"

Students are obligated to attend class regularly.  Absences,  excused or not, do not absolve students from the responsibility of completing all assigned work promptly.  

Students are expected to attend all Zoom meetings when they are live. They will be recorded, but failure to attend the live session will still count as an absence. If your personal circumstances keep you from attending the live class, please let me know immediately.

### The terms of this syllabus are subject to change fairly and with ample notice as needed.
